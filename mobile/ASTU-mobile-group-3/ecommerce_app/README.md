# Ecommerce App


A Flutter application developed using clean architecture. This approach divides the development process into three independent layers:

- ### Domain:
  
    This is the heart of the application, responsible for executing core business logic and essential functionalities. 
    It ensures that the application's rules and operations are consistently applied, providing a solid foundation for the app's behavior.
- ### Data:
  
    This layer manages all data-related operations, including data fetching, storage, and manipulation. 
    It acts as a bridge between the domain layer and various data sources, ensuring seamless data flow and integrity.
- ### Presentation:

    This is the visual aspect of the application, focusing on the user interface and user experience. 
    It presents data to the users and handles user interactions, ensuring an engaging and intuitive interface.


## Advantage og Clean Arcitecture

By separating these concerns, the application maintains high cohesion within each layer while promoting low coupling between them, resulting in a clean, maintainable, and easily testable codebase.
